# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: "Star Wars" }, { name: "Lord of the Rings" }])
#   Character.create(name: "Luke", movie: movies.first)

# user = User.create(name: 'JD')
# food = Food.create(user: user, name: 'banana', measurement_unit: 'kilos', price: 100, quantity: 45)
# recipe = Recipe.create(user: user, name: 'cafe', preparation_time: 1.5, cooking_time: 1, description: 'coffee', public: 1)
# recipefood = RecipeFood.create(food: food, recipe: recipe, quantity: 100)
